# Strict Style

A strict configuration that enforce everything to be properly typed.

```js
// tslint.json
{
  "extends": "tslint-config-unional/strict"
}
```

## Key highlights

- Ideal for i-dotter and t-crosser
- Good for beginner to avoid mistakes
- Personally not recommended as it slows down coding
